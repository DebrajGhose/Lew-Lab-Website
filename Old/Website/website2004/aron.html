<p>My research focuses on understanding the various signaling pathways that 
contribute to the morphogenesis checkpoint. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae the morphogenesis checkpoint delays mitosis in response to 
environmental perturbations that delay bud formation. We have shown that cells 
lacking Bem2p do not delay mitosis when bud formation is blocked and are therefore 
defective in some aspect of the morphogenesis checkpoint. Bem2p is a 246 kD 
protein with a 160 amino acid Rho GAP domain at its carboxyl terminus, which has 
been reported to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Rho1p. One response to checkpoint 
stimuli is the stabilization of the CDK-inhibitory kinase Swe1p, and surprisingly 
this occurs normally in <i>bem2</i>D cells. In addition perturbation of bud 
formation activates the MAP kinase Mpk1p, which appears to inhibit the CDK 
activating phosphatase Mih1p. We have shown that <i>bem2 D </i>cells activate 
Mpk1p to a similar extent compared to wild type cells, and deletion of MIH1 does 
not fully alleviate the <i>bem2</i>D checkpoint defect. This suggests that Bem2p 
has a role in a pathway leading to G2 arrest that has yet to be uncovered.</p>

<p>I am currently interested in defining a role for Bem2p in the checkpoint and 
uncovering the additional mechanisms for regulating the G2/M transition.  Possible 
mechanisms by which Bem2p might affect the G2/M transition are by regulating the 
activity of the Swe1p kinase or Mih1p phosphatase (independent of Mpk1p).  In 
order to determine if these processes are under regulation, I am developing in 
vitro and in vivo assays in which the activity of these enzymes can be measured 
independent from each other.</p>
