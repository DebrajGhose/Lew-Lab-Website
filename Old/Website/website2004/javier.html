<p>My research focuses on the connection between cell cycle control (by the 
cyclin/CDK system) and the generation of asymmetry during morphogenesis.</p>

<p>The generation of asymmetry is manifested in yeast by a striking polarization 
of the actin cytoskeleton, which underlies the polarized deposition of cell wall 
components, and cytoplasmic components, into the bud during bud formation.</p>

<p>Several years of intense scrutiny have revealed that a small GTPase, which 
belongs to the Ras superfamily, is a central regulator of cell polarization both 
in yeast and in higher eukaryotes. This protein is called Cdc42p, and is conserved 
throughout the eukaryae family. Yeast cells defective in Cdc42p function are 
unable to polarize their actin cytoskeleton, and die.</p>

<p>Cdc24p is an activator of Cdc42p. Biochemically it is an exchange factor, 
catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP in Cdc42p, thereby converting Cdc42p to an 
active form capable of signaling through its &quot;effector&quot; molecules. These 
&quot;effectors&quot; include homologs of the mammalian p21-activated kinases 
(PAKs), which have been shown to mediate Cdc42p function in that system also.</p>

<p>Our central question is, when an unbudded, unpolarized cell in early G1 decides 
to enter the cell cycle, how is polarity established? We hypothesize this occurs 
through signaling by Cdc42p. The question then becomes, does the cell cycle 
machinery regulate signaling through Cdc42p for the establishment of cell 
polarity?</p>

<p>One possibility is that the activity (and/or localization) of Cdc24p is 
regulated by cell cycle cues. So, initially we looked at the postranslational 
modification of Cdc24p through the cell cycle. We noticed that Cdc24p was 
phosphorylated in late G1, remained phosphorylated in S, and then its level of 
phosphorylation decreased in M. We also discovered that this was dependent on 
Cdc42p, Cla4p (a PAK homolog) and Bem1p (an SH3 domain containing protein).</p>

<p>So we decided to test if Bem1p could bind to Cdc42p and Cla4p, acting as a 
scaffold (we already knew from previous reports that Bem1p binds directly to 
Cdc24p). Both directly, using bacterially-expressed proteins, and in yeast 
lysates, we showed that Bem1p interacts with both of these proteins. We also 
showed that Cla4p can phosphorylate Cdc24p directly in vitro.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean? We are not sure yet. We have characterized a 
multiprotein signaling complex containing Cdc42p, its upstream regulator Cdc24p 
and a downstream effector held together by a scaffold protein. The fact that Cla4p 
phosphorylates Cdc24p directly makes us believe that there may be a feedback loop, 
possibly a positive regulatory event. My project now is moving in the direction of 
finding out what this complex is doing (if anything) within the cell.</p>
